# SPW-ShadowNet

SPW-ShadowNet: A Soft Prior-Guided Wavelet Attention Network for End-to-End Shadow Removal.

This repository contains the overview and experimental results for the paper **"SPW-ShadowNet: A Soft Prior-Guided Wavelet Attention Network for End-to-End Shadow Removal"**, which is currently under review.

We employ wavelet features to achieve soft prior modeling to guide shadow removal, achieving an optimal trade-off between restoration performance and computational efficiency.

> **Note on Code Availability**: The source code will be made publicly available immediately upon the paper's acceptance. Thank you for your interest and patience!
